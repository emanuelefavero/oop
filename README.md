# OOP - Object Oriented Programming

## What is OOP?

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs that uses "objects" to represent real-world things or concepts.

One of the main benefits of object-oriented programming is that it helps us to organize and structure our code in a logical way. It also makes it easier to reuse code and build on existing programs.

## What is an object?

An object is a self-contained piece of code that has its own properties and methods. For example, a car object might have properties like `color` and `make`, and methods like `drive()` and `stop()`.

## What is a class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have.

## What is an instance?

- An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.

_For example, if we have a class called `Car`, we can create many different instances of the `Car` class, such as a red Ford Fiesta, a blue Toyota Prius, and a black Tesla Model S._

## Benefits of OOP

- **Encapsulation** - Reduce complexity + increase reusability. _Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class from other objects. This allows us to change the implementation of a class without affecting other parts of the program._

- **Abstraction** - Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes. _Abstraction refers to the idea of exposing only the necessary details about an object, while hiding the implementation details.._

- **Inheritance** - Eliminate redundant code. _Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class. The new class is called a subclass, and the existing class is called a superclass. The subclass inherits all of the methods and properties from the superclass._

- **Polymorphism** - Refactor ugly switch/case statements. _Polymorphism is the ability to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object._

## OOP Principles - **SOLID**

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. _A class should have only one job._

- **Open/Closed Principle** - You should be able to extend classes behavior, without modifying it. _Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification._

- **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. _Derived classes must be able to completely replace their base classes without any unexpected behavior._

- **Interface Segregation Principle** - Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. _Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use._

- **Dependency Inversion Principle** - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. _High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions._
